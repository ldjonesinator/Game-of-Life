# John Conway's Game of Life

## About This Project
Just having a bit of fun with OpenGL. I wanted to improve my C++ skills and learn how OpenGL works. I decided to replicate this game to do that.
To learn OpenGL I used The Cherno's videos on youtube because he did well at explaining the aspects of what I was implementing. So a lot of my code is inspired by his series.
