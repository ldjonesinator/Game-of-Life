# John Conway's Game of Life

## About This Project
Just having a bit of fun with OpenGL. I wanted to improve my C++ skills and learn how OpenGL works. I decided to replicate this game to do that.
To learn OpenGL I used The Cherno's videos on youtube because he did well at explaining the aspects of what I was implementing. So a lot of my code is inspired by his series.

### The Rules of the Game are simple:

For a space that is populated:

- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is empty:

- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
